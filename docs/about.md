# About

## About the Author

Hello! I'm **Raffaello Baluyot**. I am a software engineer who is also working 
with machine learning. Most of the time, people refer to people like me as a
Machine Learning Engineer.

I worked in different industries such as automotive, finance, cyber security,
chat systems, computer vision, and education. Yes! I also taught courses in
universities.

## About the Website

My goal for this website is to share what I have. I plan to write **blogs** 
for the things I find interesting, challenging, or things I would like to 
share.

Another goal I have is to create a **documentation hub** for the work I've 
shared over the years in my repository and organize them here.

I did some open source contributions, but I would like to try to make share
more, hopefully.
